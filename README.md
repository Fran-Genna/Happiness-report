# Happiness in Public Policy
Using Happiness Data to Improve Local Policies


`Context and Objective`
This project was initiated by our non-profit organization with the goal of supporting local governments in adopting public policies focused on the well-being of their citizens. In a time when social cohesion, trust, and quality of life are becoming increasingly important, we decided to leverage one of the most authoritative global sources: the World Happiness Report.

Our mission was to turn happiness data into practical tools for better governance
